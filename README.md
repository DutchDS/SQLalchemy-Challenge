In this folder you will find the results for the SQLAlchemy and Flask exercises as described for week 10.

A bonus section for graphing the average temperature, with min/max temps being defining the sem (error bar) 
Including an unpaired(! because the results are not related) independent t_test to see if theres a significant difference between summer and winter months (for example- you chose!)
